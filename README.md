## (UX)

## Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience for the pizza parlour & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'Stefano's pizza ' are:
- familys, couples, singles or groups of people aged 14-50
- People after quick delicious food
- People who need some food to feed a large group in the easiest way possible.

These users will be looking for :
- An informative website, with information that is easy-to-find & concise
- Current & up-to-date menus, with essential information such as price, allergens and dietary info
- A booking form to make reservation enquiries with the restaurant
- A way to contact the restaurant
- The ability to make a user account to manage their reservations
